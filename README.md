# data-analysis-portfolio
A collection of work done in data analysis.
Hi, I'm Shaun Foley, a product and data analyst skilled in Python, SQL, Excel, Power BI, Metabase, and telling stories with data. My background in Psychology has enabled me to generate insights into health and business outcomes. I have worked in a variety of roles related to data analysis, including in Evaluation Team Lead, Graduate Data Analysis, Evaluation and Research Consultant, Psychology tutor, and my recent role as a Psychology Researcher and Data Analyst. What excites me? I love learning about new things, helping people solve problems, and creating impactful stories and visualisations from research and data analysis. I have been doing data analysis since 2013 and research since 2019. This portfolio is to give an insight into my skills in data analysis.

## Skills
- **Programming**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter), SQL
- **Visualisation**: Power BI, Metabase, Excel, and SPSS
- **Statistical Analysis**: Experimentation, A/B, Inference and Hypothesis Testing, Regression, Exploratory data analysis

## Projects
- [Coffee Shop Sales Analysis](coffee-shop-sales/): Analysed sales data to identify trends using Metabase.
- [Dentist Lead Analysis](dentist-lead-scraping/): Scraped dentist data and visualised leads in a Power BI dashboard.
- [Pokémon Strength Analysis](pokemon-analysis/): Ranked Pokémon using statistical scoring and visualisations.

## Project Breakdown
[Coffee Shop Sales Analysis](coffee-shop-sales/)
- **Tools**: Metabase, MySQL, SQL, Excel
- **Problem**: A local coffee shop needed to understand sales patterns to optimise staffing and inventory management, but lacked insights into peak hours and top-selling products.
- **Description**: Analysed transactional data from a coffee shop to identify peak sales hours and top-selling products. Built a Metabase dashboard to visualize trends, enabling the business to optimise staffing and inventory.
- **Results**: Peak sales are between 8-10 AM with weekdays generally outperforming weekends, leading to a recommendation to adjust shift schedules that focus on more staffing in the mornings.
- **Recommendations**:
  - Increase staffing during 8–10 AM to reduce customer wait times.
  - Adjust inventory to prioritise top-selling products (Coffee and Tea), reducing waste from unsold items (e.g. Clothing and House blend beans).

[Dentist Lead Analysis](dentist-lead-scraping/)
- **Tools**: Python, Google Maps API, Excel, Power BI
- **Problem**: A dental SaaS company needed to identify high-potential leads in Vienna, Berlin, and Zurich to target marketing efforts, but lacked data on dentist distribution and revenue potential.
- **Description**: This project scrapes dentist data from Google Maps for Vienna, Berlin, and Zurich, analyses the data, and visualises key metrics in an interactive Power BI dashboard. The goal is to identify potential leads for a dental service by forecasting revenue and mapping dentist distribution.
- **Results**: Berlin had the largest dentist population with Vienna and Zurich following next. Analysis identified revenue opportunities for a SAAS targeting dentist populations. If 10% was converted of each city, this would lead to a revenue of $136k per month. 
- **Recommendations**:
  - Prioritise marketing in Berlin due to its larger dentist population and then move into marketing in Vienna.
  - Tailor SaaS features to address regional needs.
  - Use a Power BI dashboard to track lead conversion progress and refine targeting.

[Pokémon Strength Analysis](pokemon-analysis/)
- **Tools**: Python, MySQL, Metabase, Power BI
- **Problem**: Pokémon players need a data-driven approach to build optimal teams and insight into stat trends, type effectiveness, and top-performing Pokémon across generations.
- **Description**: This analysis explored which pokemon matchups worked best, stat trends across generations, and assess type effectiveness.
- **Results**: The top 6 team was a mix of Dragon, Water, Steel, and Rock (based on sum of total_points). This team focused on non-legendary pokemon: Ash-Greninja, Mega-Garchomp, Mega Gyradados, Mega Metagross, Mega Salamence, and Mega Tyranitar. Dragon types have the highest average total points. Arceus (720 points, Mythical) leads the non-legendary in Mythical, while Slaking (670 points, Normal) tops non-legendary pokemon. 
- **Recommendations**: 
  - Build teams around Dragon and Steel types for high stat totals and type coverage.
  - Include Mega evolutions like Mega-Garchomp for competitive battles due to their stat boosts.
  - Use the Power BI dashboard to explore matchups and counter-strategies for specific opponents.
